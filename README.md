To run the code on your computer, clone the [repository](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/Genetic-Algorithem/archive/master.zip) and run [index.m](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/Genetic-Algorithem/blob/master/index.m) on MatLab environment.

### LIST OF FILES 
* [Jx.m](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/Genetic-Algorithem/blob/master/Jx.m)  -> The function to find the optimum point.
* [binNumbInv.m](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/Genetic-Algorithem/blob/master/binNumbInv.m) -> This function helps you to convert binary strings into double variables (inverse function of the *numbConv*) for *crossover* and other operations.
* [costF.m](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/Genetic-Algorithem/blob/master/costF.m) -> This is the cost function calculator used to assign weights for each value of the function.
* [index.m](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/Genetic-Algorithem/blob/master/index.m) -> The main method of the program. Run this file when you are ready with cloane of the repository.
* [numbConv.m](https://github.com/DarshanaUOP/Genetic-Algorithem/blob/master/numbConv.m) -> Convert double variables into binary values corresponding to the number of bits will consider in the process.
